# About Clojurians Log

Welcome to Clojurians Log, a public archive of the [Clojurians Slack community](http://clojurians.net), going back all the way to 2015.

We store these messages for posterity, so that the vast amounts of knowledge
that are shared there are not lost, but instead are accessible to all, including
search engines.

This Clojurians log is an offshoot of [ClojureVerse](https://clojureverse.org),
a Clojure forum run by and for the community. We strongly believe that a strong
and healthy community should create and manage its own spaces. ClojureVerse
embodies that philosophy.

But the reality is that many conversations are still happening inside Slack's
walled garden. Slack serves the community well, but it's also where
information goes to die. We try to give all those valuable conversations a new
lease on life.

If a channel is not showing up in the logs then make sure you invite `@logbot`
to the channel. While you're at it, you can also invite `@zulip-mirror-bot`, a
bot which mirrors Slack channels to [Clojurians Zulip](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/).

The code that powers this site can be found on Github. The main application is
written in Clojure, and we warmly welcome contributions. Together we continue to
make this a better place.
